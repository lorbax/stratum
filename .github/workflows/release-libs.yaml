# This workflow is used to publish SV2 crates to cratesio
# The workflow try to update all the library crates so if a crate is not to updated, the step will fail
# for that each step have continue-on-error set to true.
# Since each step can fail the output ot the action must be manually check to macke sure that all
# the library intended to be published are published.
# Runing cargo release in the various workspace help to prepare the version number and everything.
# ATTENTION
# Is very important to check the output manually cause when too many crates are updated crates.io could fail
# and ask to rerun the action later
